# Minecraft Custom Recipe plugin

This plugin allows custom recipes to be made in a user-friendly GUI, whilst being able to account for model data, display names and any other modified vanilla items, making it useful for events using custom items.
Custom recipes will override vanilla recipes if the result is the same and all recipes are kept in a data file so recipes are kept on server restart.

## Commands

/CustomRecipe add [name]  
/CustomRecipe remove [name]  
/CustomRecipe show [name]
